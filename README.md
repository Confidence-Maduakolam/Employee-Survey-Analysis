### DATA VISUALISATION AND INSIGHTS

##### •1. Which survey questions did respondents Agree with or disagree with most?

Firstly I used Stacked Bar chart which separated my Agreed and Disagreed Response Text with dark blue and light blue
 Agree: Dark blue
 Disagree: Light blue
 
Question 9, My Department is inclusive and demonstrate support of a diverse workforce ( this question have 663 employee response).

Question10, Overall I am satisfied with my job, have a number of 638 employee response.

Question 8, My Supervisor hold employees accountable for their performance, have 634 response.

Question 2, At work I have the opportunity to do what I do best every day have 618 response etc.

The above mentioned questions have relative high Agreed Response not below 600 employee response indicating clear communication of job expectations.

##### •2. Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

This visual is gotten by using bar chart to combine department and Response text to identify patterns in the survey responses which shows planning and public works with the highest Agreed and Strongly agreed response.

Some departments like the "Planning and public works" and "Sherriff's department" have higher proportions of "Agree and Strongly Agree" responses combined, indicating possibly better management, job satisfaction in these areas and are aligned with their organization's goals.

##### - Analysis for most Negative Response

To get this I choose the matrix visuals which the questions is on row, response text is on columns and value of each response
The above picture contains the survey questions with the highest counts of negative responses (either "Disagree" or "Strongly Disagree").

### Key Areas for Improvement:

- Social Connections at Work: The question 6. "I have a best friend at work" has the highest number of negative responses, suggesting a need for initiatives to improve workplace relationships and team bonding.

- Enhance Diversity and Inclusion Programs: Given the polarized views on inclusivity (Question 9), developing and enhancing diversity and inclusion training and initiatives could help improve employee perceptions and foster a more supportive work environment.

- Accountability and Recognition: With mixed responses on supervisor accountability (Question 8) and recognition (Question 3), there is a need to standardize performance evaluation processes and recognition programs to ensure fairness and transparency.

- Focus on Employee Development: Responses to Question 7 about opportunities to learn and grow suggest a need for more robust professional development and career advancement programs, particularly in departments with lower satisfaction scores.

- Department-Specific Interventions: Tailor interventions and improvements based on specific department needs, as shown by the varied response patterns. Departments with lower agreement might require more focused team-building and management training.

- Regular Feedback Mechanisms: Implement more frequent and structured feedback mechanisms to continually gauge employee sentiment and adjust strategies accordingly.
  
By addressing these areas, employers can work towards enhancing overall employee satisfaction and engagement, leading to a more motivated and productive workforce.
